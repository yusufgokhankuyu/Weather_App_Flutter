WhatTheWeather App with API

## project Decription

In this project, I displayed the data using the weather API. I used a splash screen at the beginning of my application. Additionally, the user can learn the weather forecast for a week by selecting a city from the application or learn the weather forecast based on the user's location. I used Google Maps API to find the user's location. I also created a model that recommends suggestions and activities based on the weather. It gives activity suggestions and recommendations to users according to the temperature value.
